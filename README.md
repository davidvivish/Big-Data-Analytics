# **Final Project: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Bike Lane Installations on Cyclist Safety in New York City**

## **Project Description**
This project aims to analyze the impact of bike lane installations on cyclist safety in New York City. The study evaluates whether adding bike lanes effectively reduces cyclist injuries and fatalities by leveraging extensive datasets detailing motor vehicle collisions and bike lane installations. 

## **Motivation**
Cyclist safety is a growing concern in urban environments like NYC, where cycling is a standard mode of transport. Despite efforts to expand bike lanes, their effectiveness in reducing accidents remains unclear. This study investigates this issue by analyzing:
- Trends in cyclist injuries and fatalities over time.
- Relationships between bike lane installations and cyclist safety metrics.

## **Key Findings**
1. **Data Insights**:
   - While bike lane installations have increased, there is no consistent trend correlating them with reduced injuries or fatalities.
   - Specific boroughs, like Manhattan, showed reduced collision rates in areas with new bike lanes, but others, such as Brooklyn and Queens, did not experience the same improvement.

2. **Policy Implications**:
   - Simply adding bike lanes may not be sufficient. Other measures, such as public awareness campaigns, enhanced traffic enforcement, and improved road design, are necessary.

## **Data Sources**
1. **Motor Vehicle Collisions Data**: NYC Open Data platform.
2. **Bike Lane Installation Data**: NYC Department of Transportation.
