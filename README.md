# **Project: Elderly Pedestrian Safety at Urban Intersections**
This project was conducted by a group of students from CIEN E4011: Big Data Analytics in Transportation at Columbia University.

## **Project Description**
This project dives into the challenges faced by elderly pedestrians when crossing urban intersections, focusing on Amsterdam Avenue and 106th Street. By analyzing traffic signals and pedestrian behaviors, we identified ways to make intersections safer and more accessible for older adults. Combining traffic data and surveys, we came up with actionable insights to improve safety and mobility.

## **Objectives**
1. Understand how traffic signal operations impact the safety and mobility of older pedestrians.
2. Suggest practical infrastructure and signal changes to create senior-friendly urban spaces.

## **Key Insights**
1. **Traffic Patterns**:
   - Traffic flow at the intersection is dominated by vehicles, especially heading north and south.
   - Older pedestrians are a smaller group but face higher risks due to slower walking speeds and mobility challenges.

2. **Survey Results**:
   - 89.5% of respondents said auditory traffic cues are helpful for crossing intersections.
   - Many older pedestrians felt that crossing times were too short, highlighting the need for longer signal durations.

3. **Recommendations**:
   - Extend crossing times at busy intersections, especially during peak hours.
   - Add pedestrian-friendly features like auditory signals, islands, and wider sidewalks to make intersections safer.

## **Data Sources**
- **Traffic Data**: Video recordings capturing vehicle, cyclist, and pedestrian movements at the Amsterdam Avenue and 106th Street intersection.
- **Survey Data**: Structured interviews with pedestrians aged 65 and older.
